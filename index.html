<h2> About Me: 
</h2>
<p> In my current job, I work directly with our developer team and I've been very interested in learning more about their jobs. I really like being able to work together to get the right help to our clients! I'm looking forward to being able to assist clients or our company internally by being able to understand coding and put it good use. </p>

<p>Outside of work and studying web development, I love to run and participate in a lot of 5k's and Half Marathons! </p>
