# Portfolio-Part-1
HTML &amp; CSS portfolio 

I had troubles getting the lists to align evenly. 
The site opens with my name, the bootcamp I'm at, and where I'm at in my process right now! (still in the bootcamp)

Followed by an intro to myself and then a little bit about me! I had troubles getting the lists to align evenly. 
Last is a couple of contact links.
